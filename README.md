# Eluvio CHallenge
### Introduction 

We are being asked to "find a problem" to solve in a given Dataset from Eluvio. It contains small 
titles of users which mainly seem to be about conflicts,geopolitical news,wars etc. The dataset  also gives us other information too(if they are adults,their username,upvotes,downvotes,etc). I decided to use spaCy at first but I also used gensim for unsupervised clustering.

### spaCy
Considering Eluvio's very large datasets I had to first  find the best performing open-source library in order to maximize speed and efficiency at which we process our data.Spacy is a very popular library that provide us with what we need.As we can see from its benchmarks it perfoms very well.

Spacy provides its users with pre-trained "pipelines" that can be installed as Python packages.

Below is a summary of the features spaCy is providing:

**Pretrained model used:** en_core_web_lg (lg indicating the large volume of text it was pretrained on)

**Pipeline**: ['tok2vec', 'tagger', 'parser', 'ner', 'attribute_ruler', 'lemmatizer']


* **Tokenization**: Segments text into words,punctuations marks,etc
* **tok2vec**: Transforms tokens into vectors and saves them in Token.vector. The library generates word vectors using an algorithm called word2vec under the hood.
* **tagger**: Assigning word types to tokens,like verb or noun.
* **parser**: Assigns syntantic dependency labels,describing the relations between individual tokens,like subject or object.
* **ner**: labelling named "real-world" objects, like persons,companies or locations.
* **attribute_ruler**: manages rule-based mappings and exceptions for all token-level attributes
* **lemmatizer**: Assigns the base forms of words. For example, the lemma of ‚Äúwas‚Äù is ‚Äúbe‚Äù, and the lemma of ‚Äúrats‚Äù is ‚Äúrat‚Äù.


This project also uses spaCy "projects".SpaCy projects let you manage and share end-to-end spaCy workflows for different use cases and domains, and orchestrate training, packaging and serving your custom pipelines. It also makes it easy to integrate many other tools. SpaCy projects also make it easy to integrate with many other tools.https://spacy.io/usage/projects

# ü™ê spaCy Project: Eluvio

 Eluvio's challenge in predictive modelling or analytical insights for business use cases  

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `preprocess` | Convert the data to spaCy's binary format and output the result in the corpus directory  |
| `phrasematch` | Runs some phrase matching examples from a json file(assets/phrasematches.json) |
| `dependencymatch` | Runs some dependency matching examples from a json file(assets/dependencymatches.json) |
| `VisualizePhraseResults` | It visualizes phrase matched results  |
| `VisualizeDependencyResults` | It visualizes dependency matched results  |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `preprocess` &rarr; `phrasematch` &rarr; `dependencymatch` &rarr; `VisualizePhraseResults` &rarr; `VisualizeDependencyResults` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`assets/Eluvio_DS_Challenge.csv`](assets/Eluvio_DS_Challenge.csv) | Local | CSV data given from Eluvio |
| [`assets/phrasematches.json`](assets/phrasematches.json) | Local | JSON-formatted input phrase matches for testing |

Since, we are interested in extracting information from the dataset it makes sense to use spaCy's "matchers".

#### Below are the phrase matcher test cases:

#### Below are the dependency matcher test cases
